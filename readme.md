## Installation & Requirements 🔧

Before you run the converter, please ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**  
  If you do not have Python installed, or to ensure Python 3.11.9 is added to your system PATH automatically **without administrator rights**, simply run the included `python3119.bat` file. This batch file configures your environment for you.

- **FFmpeg**  
  Required for video and audio conversion.  
  Download from [FFmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your system PATH.

- **Pillow, CustomTkinter, and Tk**  
  Install these Python packages by running:
```
pip install Pillow customtkinter tk
```
